## Informations
* we will use this as free undetected injector by valve (at this moment)
* this would be patched in the future actually it works well
* this idea was done through the public education (its up from 2k18 +-)
* but this tool is automatized and doesnt has any issues
* this tool is best to use when you have undetected cheat (.dll) 
* then you dont need any private injector or something 
* just use this tool and be safe thanks to Valve! 

## Questions
* why do I replacing our fake original back to the right original? 
* at this momnent we just want to avoid some issues with injecting
* thats mean if we keep our fake original then every time when u open the game
* the cheat get injected so that's my way how to avoid this issue
* if you have some problems with compile please use (release x86)

## Risk 
* there isnt any risk you can just get banned for the cheat (.dll) 
* thats mean if the .dll (cheat) is detected but this tool doesnt do anything with the csgo memory
* if someone just get banned its not my bad your cheat was just detected 
* how I said above this method is undetected since CS:S was released
